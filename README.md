# react-travel-journal #

I created this travel journal site to understand React props better. <br>
I also integrated a Data.JSX file to get a better understanding on data driven components. <br>
<b>Here's the link to the live site: https://traveljournal-byaj.netlify.app/ </b><br>
Let me know how you like it. <br>
Thank you <br>
